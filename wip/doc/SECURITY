===============================================================

---------------------

* The Heartbleed_ Bug (also known as CVE-2014-0160_) is a serious
  vulnerability in the OpenSSL library. When the weakness is exploited it
  leads to the leak of memory contents from the server to the client, or
  from the client to the server.

  mbank-cli uses the OpenSSL library under the hood to connect to the mBank
  server. It is believed that exploiting Heartbleed to attack mbank-cli,
  while difficult, is feasible.

  It is highly recommended that users of affected versions of OpenSSL:

    1) Upgrade the OpenSSL library.

    2) Log out from any existing mbank-cli sessions.

    3) Change the mBank password.
