mbank-cli (20140505) unstable; urgency=low

  Security improvements:

  * mbank-cli now uses IO::Socket::SSL (rather that Net::SSL aka
    Crypt::SSLeay) as the SSL/TLS backend.

  * mbank-cli no longer trusts any certificate authorities, except for VeriSign
    Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority.

mbank-cli (20120704) unstable; urgency=low

mbank-cli (20120617) unstable; urgency=high

  * mbank-cli no longer creates debug files automatically by default. Use the
    --debug option to enable this feature.

  * Due to a bug in the LWP module, if the IO::Socket::SSL module was
    installed, mbank-cli did not verify the SSL certificate, making
    man-in-the-middle attacks feasible.

    It is highly recommended that affected users:

      1) Upgrade mbank-cli to 20120617 (or a later version).

      2) Invalidate the existing mbank-cli session:

         cd /path/to/mbank-cli
         ./mbank-cli logout

      3) Change the mBank password.

mbank-cli (20110215) unstable; urgency=medium

  mbank-cli did not ensure that files (including some of security-sensitive
  nature, e.g. the cookie jar) are created with secure permissions.

  It is highly recommended that users:

    1) Upgrade to 20110215 (or a later version).

    2) If the files were actually exposed to other local users, follow this
       procedure:

       cd /path/to/mbank-cli
       chmod -R go-rwx .  # revoke excessive permissions
       ./mbank-cli logout  # invalidate existing session
       rm -f cookie-jar.txt  # unlink the cookie jar
       rm -f debug/*  # unlink the debug dumps

mbank-cli (20091208) unstable; urgency=high

  mbank-cli did not check whether the server hostname matches the Common Name
  (CN) of the SSL certificate, making man-in-the-middle attacks feasible.

  It is highly recommended that users:

    1) Upgrade mbank-cli to 20091208 (or a later version).

    2) Invalidate the existing mbank-cli session:

       cd /path/to/mbank-cli
       ./mbank-cli logout

    3) Change the mBank password.
