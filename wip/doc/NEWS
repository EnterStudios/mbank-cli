mbank-cli (20140505) unstable; urgency=low

  Security improvements:

  * mbank-cli now uses IO::Socket::SSL (rather that Net::SSL aka
    Crypt::SSLeay) as the SSL/TLS backend.

  * mbank-cli no longer trusts any certificate authorities, except for VeriSign
    Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority.

mbank-cli (20120617) unstable; urgency=high

  * mbank-cli no longer creates debug files automatically by default. Use the
    --debug option to enable this feature.

  * Due to a bug in the LWP module, if the IO::Socket::SSL module was
    installed, mbank-cli did not verify the SSL certificate, making
    man-in-the-middle attacks feasible. This bug is now fixed.

    Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

mbank-cli (20110215) unstable; urgency=medium

  mbank-cli did not ensure that files (including some of security-sensitive
  nature, e.g. the cookie jar) are created with secure permissions. This bug
  is now fixed.

  Please consult the SECURITY file for details.

mbank-cli (20091208) unstable; urgency=high

  mbank-cli did not check whether the server hostname matches the Common Name
  (CN) of the SSL certificate, making man-in-the-middle attacks feasible. This
  bug is now fixed.

  Please consult the SECURITY file for details.
