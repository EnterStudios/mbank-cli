Security advisories for *mbank-cli* and the dependent libraries
===============================================================

2014-05-01: missing certificate validation
------------------------------------------

Due to a bug in the LWP module, if the IO::Socket::SSL module was installed,
mbank-cli did not verify the SSL certificate, making man-in-the-middle
attacks feasible.

It is highly recommended that affected users:

   1) Upgrade mbank-cli to 20120617 (or a later version).

   2) Log out from any existing mbank-cli sessions.

   3) Change the mBank password.

2014-04-09: Heatblead
---------------------

The Heartbleed_ Bug (also known as CVE-2014-0160_) is a serious
vulnerability in the OpenSSL library. When the weakness is exploited it
leads to the leak of memory contents from the server to the client, or
from the client to the server.

mbank-cli uses the OpenSSL library under the hood to connect to the mBank
server. It is believed that exploiting Heartbleed to attack mbank-cli,
while difficult, is feasible.

It is highly recommended that users of affected versions of OpenSSL:

   1) Upgrade the OpenSSL library.

   2) Log out from any existing mbank-cli sessions.

   3) Change the mBank password.

2012-02-15: insecure file permissions
-------------------------------------

mbank-cli did not ensure that files (including some of security-sensitive
nature, e.g. the session cookie storage file) are created with secure
permissions.

It is highly recommended that users:

   1) Upgrade to 20120215 (or a later version).

   2) Log out from any existing mbank-cli sessions.

   3) Truncate and unlink any files that were exposed to other local users.

Note that pervious version of this advisory incorrectly stated that the bug
was fixed in 20110215.

2009-12-08: insufficient certificate validation
-----------------------------------------------

mbank-cli did not check whether the server hostname matches the Common Name
(CN) of the SSL certificate, making man-in-the-middle attacks feasible.

It is highly recommended that users:

   1) Upgrade mbank-cli to 20091208 (or a later version).

   2) Log out from any existing mbank-cli sessions.

   3) Change the mBank password.
