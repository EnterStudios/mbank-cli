mbank-cli (20110215) unstable; urgency=medium

  mbank-cli didn't ensure that files (including some of security-sensitive
  nature, e.g. the cookie jar) are created with secure permissions.

  If your files were actually exposed to other local users, the following
  procedure is highly recommended:

     cd /path/to/mbank-cli
     chmod -R go-rwx .  # revoke excessive permissions
     ./mbank-cli logout  # invalidate existing session
     rm -f cookie-jar.txt  # unlink the cookie jar
     rm -f debug/*  # unlink the debug dumps

mbank-cli (20091208) unstable; urgency=high

  It was discovered that mbank-cli did not check if SSL certificate CN matched
  the host name, making attacks feasible. Upgrading to this version (or later)
  is highly recommended.
